Exercise:
There are a few concepts in this lesson, but all are pretty straight-forward to apply.
To spice things up, we've gone and scrambled the Movies table for you in the exercise to better mimic what kind of data you might see in real life.
Try and use the necessary keywords and clauses introduced above in your queries.

1. List all directors of Pixar movies (alphabetically), without duplicates.
    
    SELECT Distinct(Director)
    FROM movies
    ORDER BY Director  ASC;
    
    
 2. List the last four Pixar movies released (ordered from most recent to least).
 
          SELECT Title,YEAR
          FROM movies
          ORDER BY YEAR DESC
          LIMIT 4;
          
 3. List the first five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically.
   
       SELECT DISTINCT (Title)
        FROM movies
       ORDER BY TITLE ASC
       LIMIT 5;
      
  4. List the next five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically.
  
      SELECT Title
     FROM movies
     ORDER BY Title ASC
      LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
      --- The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.
