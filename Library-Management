Take the example of your college library, where both teachers and students can issue books. 
Usually, the number of days within which you have to return the book varies for both the groups.
Also, each book has a unique ID, even if they are copies of the same book by the same author.
So, a library management system has an entry for every book, capturing who has issued it, the issue duration, and the amount of fine, if any.
